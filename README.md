•	src/curves/inflation_curve_builder.py: Builds inflation zero-coupon swap curves.
•	src/curves/bond_curve_builder.py: Placeholder for bond curve construction, as the original content was not provided.
Instruments (src/instruments/):
•	src/instruments/base_instrument.py: Abstract base class for all financial instruments.
•	src/instruments/swap.py: Defines the SwapParameters (replacing the inferred swap_class) and the Swap instrument itself.
•	src/instruments/option.py: Defines the Option instrument class, serving as a base for specific option types.
•	src/instruments/bond.py: Defines the Bond instrument class for general bond properties.
Pricers (src/pricers/):
•	src/pricers/swap_pricer.py: Consolidates logic for pricing swaps and calculating related metrics.
•	src/pricers/inflation_pricer.py: Contains logic for pricing inflation zero-coupon swaps.
•	src/pricers/linker_carry_calculator.py: Contains the logic for calculating carry for inflation-linked bonds.
Volatility Surface (src/volatility_surface/):
•	src/volatility_surface/base_vol_surface.py: Abstract base class for volatility surface builders.
•	src/volatility_surface/bond_future_vol_surface.py: Builds volatility surfaces for bond futures options.
•	src/volatility_surface/stir_vol_surface.py: Builds volatility surfaces for STIR (Short Term Interest Rate) options.
Strategy Analytics (src/strategy_analytics/):
•	src/strategy_analytics/option_strategy.py: Consolidates logic for analyzing option strategies.
Market Tables (src/market_tables/):
•	src/market_tables/bond_tables.py: Generates the linker monitor table.
•	src/market_tables/inflation_tables.py: Handles the generation of tables for inflation swap rates.
•	src/market_tables/swap_tables.py: Placeholder for swap table generation, as the original content was not provided.
Market Data Processors (src/market_data_processors/):
•	src/market_data_processors/economic_data_processor.py: Handles retrieval, transformation, and initial analysis of economic data.
•	src/market_data_processors/wirp_processor.py: Handles calculation and historical management of WIRP (World Interest Rate Probability) metrics.
Plotting (src/plotting/):
•	src/plotting/base_plotter.py: Abstract base class for plotting functionalities.
•	src/plotting/matplotlib_plots.py: Implements various Matplotlib-based plotting functions.
•	src/plotting/bokeh_plots.py: Implements various Bokeh-based interactive plotting functions.
Main Entry Point:
•	main.py: A comprehensive example script demonstrating how to use the new modules and run typical workflows.
________________________________________
Before you dive in:
•	Bloomberg Connection: Ensure your Bloomberg terminal is running and that the pdblp library can connect to it.
•	Data Lake: Make sure you have the data/data_lake/ directory set up in your project root, and populate it with any .pkl files (historical curve nodes, inflation fixings, WIRP history) and the eco_master.xlsx file that your original code relied on. The main.py script has comments about which files are expected.
•	Dependencies: Confirm all Python packages are installed (e.g., pandas, numpy, QuantLib, pdblp, PyYAML, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh).
•	Review Comments: Pay special attention to the comments I've added, particularly those indicating areas where Bloomberg tickers or specific financial calculations (fut_payoff, get_1y1y_fwd) were inferred or require your domain-specific verification.
This rewrite aims to make your infrastructure more efficient, clearer, and state-of-the-art. I'm ready for your questions as you start exploring the new codebase!
